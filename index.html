        <h1>Dogs are the Best</h1>
        <h2>“What are some common characteristics of dogs and the roles they play in human society?”</h2>
        <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary
            widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail),
            powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared
            to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform
            many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding
            disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>
